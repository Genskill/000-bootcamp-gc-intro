# Notes

Create a new file called `largest.py`

Inside this file, create a single function called `largest`

`largest` should accept 3 numerical arguments and return the largest
of the 3.

# Example

     >>> largest(1,2,3)
     3
     >>> largest(5,2,3)
     5
     >>> largest(5,9,3)
     9
     >>>
